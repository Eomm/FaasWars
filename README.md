# FaasWars

This is the script of Cortex2, the bot with which I participated and won two Faas Wars finals in season 1.

There is also the Cortex script which earned second place in February.

The two scripts have the same structure, they differ only slightly in the logic of some features.

The code is not very clean but in the next days I will try to add some explanations of the key features.
